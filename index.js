Sass puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with her skill and passion for the game again. Macie breaks records. George breaks records. Sasslyn breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.",

She struggles to adjust her eyes to the glare of her computer screen, yearning to view her beloved twitch chat one more time. All she sees is degenerate weeb spam. Her eyes brim with tears. She begins gasping her final breath, and in her final moments she hits the hardest dab known to humanity",
